# what is spark.

- Is the most popular unified computing engine and set of libraries for distributing processing at scale
- big data = a lot of data that cannot fit on a standard computer. spark was built for this task.

### spark supports a variety of data processing tasks.

- data loading
- sql queries
- machine learning
- streaming

### unified

- consistent, composable APIs in multiple languages.
- optimizations across different libraries.

- computing engine, detached from data storage & IO.
- separated from where de data resided and where its fetched.
