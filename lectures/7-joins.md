### Joins

Joins combine data from multiple DataFrames, multiple tables in DB terms

- One (or more) columns from table 1 (**left**) is compared with one (or more) columns from table 2 (**right**).
- If the conditions passed, rows are combined.
- Non-matching rows are discarded.

#### **Joins are wide transformations**
